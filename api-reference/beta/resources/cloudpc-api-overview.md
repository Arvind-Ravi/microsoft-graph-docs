# Working with Windows 365 Cloud PCs using the Microsoft Graph API

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Windows 365 is a cloud-based service that provisions and hosts Cloud PCs as virtual machines for end users. Administrators can easily set up, manage, and scale Windows 365 Cloud PCs to fit the organization's needs. Individual end users can securely stream their rich, personalized Windows experience - including their apps, data, content, and settings - from the Microsoft cloud to any device, any time, with their Windows 365 Cloud PC.

The Microsoft Graph API enables programmatic access to Cloud PC information and management actions on your organization. The API performs the same operations as those available through Microsoft Endpoint Manager. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the Microsoft Graph API for Cloud PCs requires an active [Windows 365 license](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365) for the organization. Currently, Microsoft Graph API is available for Windows 365 Enterprise and not Windows 365 Business. 

## Using the Microsoft Graph API for Cloud PCs

With Microsoft Graph, you can provision and manage Cloud PCs in your organization. If used in conjunction with the Intune API, you can manage Cloud PCs alongside physical endpoints as well. 

## Using Microsoft Graph permissions

Microsoft Graph controls access to resources via permissions. As a developer, you must specify the permissions you need to access Windows 365 resources. Typically, you specify the permissions in the Azure Active Directory portal. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference) and navigate to the [Cloud PC permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#cloud-pc-permissions) section.
